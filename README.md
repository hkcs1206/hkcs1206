# About Me
I am an undergrad currently enrolled in two degree courses.
Computers and technologies have always been my field of interest. Exploring new domains is exciting.
I am obsessed with pets.
I am a good team player. I love to connect with people around me. Traveling is the best way to take a break from my routine.
Respect and empathy toward all living beings will help make the world a better place.
